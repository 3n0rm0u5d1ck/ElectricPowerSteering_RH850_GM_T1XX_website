<p><b>Overview </b></p>
<p>This application note addresses a hardware dependent topic of microcontrollers which may lead to a corruption of </p>
<p>data entities in the flash memory. This document describes alignment attributes and ECC (Error Correction Code) </p>
<p>error handling of the flash memory hardware and how the MICROSAR Flash EEPROM Emulation (FEE) has to be </p>
<p>configured in order to avoid problems. </p>
<p>In section 2 the problem is illustrated on the basis of a particular microcontroller family, which is affected by this </p>
<p>behavior. </p>
<p>Section 3 describes the MICROSAR FEE alignment characteristics and points out configuration details, which have </p>
<p>to be taken into account. </p>
<p>In section 4 microcontroller families are listed which are known to show the described behavior. </p>
<p><b>2.0 </b></p>
<p><b>Hardware Alignment Problem </b></p>
<p>The following hardware dependent problem is illustrated on basis of Freescale MPC560xB (Bolero) microcontroller </p>
<p>family. Generally the characteristics of every microcontroller should be examined to the effect that the described </p>
<p>problem is prevented. </p>
<p>In some microcontrollers, for instance in Freescale’s MPC560xB family, the hardware specific write alignment </p>
<p>differs from the read alignment. Particularly this can cause an issue if the read alignment is greater than the write </p>
<p>alignment. In this case the treatment of ECC (Error Correction Code) errors by the microcontroller can result in </p>
<p>corruption of data entities. </p>
<p>By way of illustration and for further considerations the alignment properties of MPC560xB family are depicted in </p>
<p>the following table: </p>
<p>Write alignment </p>
<p>8 byte (64 Bit) </p>
<p>Read alignment </p>
<p>16 byte (128 Bit) </p>

<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>In figure 1 the addressing schemes of this hardware is described in accordance with read- or write-accesses to the </p>
<p>flash memory. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Figure 1 – Memory addressing </p>
<p> </p>
<p>For further considerations: The smallest writable unit in this flash is called a page with a size of 8 byte. </p>
<p>The handling of programming (write) accesses differs from read accesses due to the alignment sizes. On the one </p>
<p>hand, programming the flash memory is possible with a page size of 8 byte (64 Bit) and therefore the write </p>
<p>addresses have to be aligned to 8 byte boundaries. On the other hand reading from the flash memory is hardware </p>
<p>specifically aligned to 16 byte boundaries. In consequence, the data being read from the flash memory contains </p>
<p>two pages of written data. It is required by AUTOSAR to provide memory abstraction and non-aligned memory </p>
<p>access. Nevertheless when performing read jobs, this flash memory controller always accesses 16 byte-sized </p>
<p>address spaces due to internal constraints. Therefore even if only one byte is requested by the application, the </p>
<p>flash memory controller accesses 16 bytes of data. As a consequence misaligned read accesses to hardware may </p>
<p>be accomplished by several 16 byte reads. The requested data then is extracted from the received packages and </p>
<p>assembled correctly before passing it to the upper layer. </p>
<p>For each written page (8 byte) one ECC is calculated to add some redundancy to a data set, which can be used to </p>
<p>check its consistency, and to recover data determined to be corrupted. The ECC implemented within the flash </p>
<p>memory module will correct single bit failures and detect double bit failures. Correction of single bit errors takes </p>
<p>place within the flash memory controller whereas the flash cell content remains unchanged. Depending on the </p>
<p>used platform, e.g. MPC560xB, ECC error handling varies. For further considerations the ECC error handling is </p>
<p>evaluated with regard to the microcontroller family MPC560xB.  </p>
<p>If an uncorrectable ECC error occurs, an error response is signaled and the requested access is terminated with </p>
<p>an error. This implies that an ECC error in one page results in an erroneous read operation which actually </p>
<p>accesses two pages of written data. Hence reading from an address aligned to the 16 byte boundary fails if just </p>
<p>one page therein contains an uncorrectable ECC error. As a result the second potentially error-free page within this </p>
<p>read boundary will be treated as corrupted thereby as well. </p>
<p>The reason for an uncorrectable ECC error in a flash page is for example an aborted programming access due to a </p>
<p>reset. Figure 2 illustrates how one ECC error affects read operations. </p>

<p> </p>
<p>Figure 2 – ECC error affects read operation </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Figure 2 depicts that one ECC error within a 16 byte address boundary leads to an unsuccessful reading. If one </p>
<p>ECC error is received during read access, the flash memory controller does not update the read buffer. Thus </p>
<p>reading from this address fails even if one of the two pages is consistent.  </p>
<p>This means the occurrence of one uncorrectable ECC error in a page treats the neighboring page within the 16 </p>
<p>byte address boundary also as corrupted. This situation is particularly problematic if the start addresses of two </p>
<p>neighboring data blocks are not aligned to 16 byte address boundaries, as shown in figure 3. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Figure 3 – Two data blocks not aligned to 16 Byte (128-bit) address boundaries </p>
<p> </p>
<p>As depicted in figure 3, an ECC error in one data block may result in the corruption of another data block. Either </p>
<p>the first page of data block 2 (left diagram) or the last page of data block 1 (right diagram) cannot be read in case </p>
<p>of an ECC error in the other block. Usually the first and the last pages of a data block contain information (e.g. </p>
<p>block id, block length) which is used for management purposes. If these pages cannot be read the entire data </p>
<p>block may be corrupted.  </p>
<p>An application using the MICROSAR FEE with such insufficient alignment settings may run in data consistency </p>
<p>issues as described in the following example: </p>
<p>A (simplified) configuration contains one block with multiple instances. After writing this block several times, the </p>
<p>programming access is aborted due to a reset while writing the first page of the block. In consequence the block </p>
<p>with latest data was not written successfully and an uncorrectable ECC error occurs. Generally, when reading data </p>
<p>of a specific block from flash memory, the MICROSAR FEE returns the content of the last written data. In case the </p>

<p> </p>
<p>last written instance is corrupt, e.g. due to a write abort (reset), the MICROSAR FEE returns the second latest </p>
<p>data. In this scenario the uncorrectable ECC error in the latest instance corrupts the second latest instance and </p>
<p>thus the MICROSAR FEE returns the data of the third latest instance to the application. Thus it cannot be assured </p>
<p>that the returned data is up-to-date. </p>
<p>A worst case scenario would be a completely corrupted flash image caused by an uncorrectable ECC error at </p>
<p>particular positions. As a result, neither read nor write accesses to the flash memory would be possible. </p>
<p>Regarding the impact of this behavior on an application, if reading data from the flash memory the following results </p>
<p>are possible: </p>
<p>•</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Successful reading, no ECC error occurred, last written data is returned to the application </p>
<p>•</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Successful reading, ECC error occurred, outdated data is returned to the application </p>
<p>•</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Unsuccessful reading, ECC error occurred, no data is returned to the application </p>
<p><b>3.0 </b></p>
<p><b>FEE Alignment Configuration </b></p>
<p>The MICROSAR FEE (Flash EEPROM Emulation) implementation is capable of addressing this hardware behavior </p>
<p>by providing two different alignment settings. It is distinguished between: </p>
<p>•</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Write Alignment </p>
<p>•</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Address Alignment </p>
<p>Following sections describe both FEE alignments’ purposes.  </p>
<p><b>3.1 </b></p>
<p><b>FEE Write Alignment </b></p>
<p>The write alignment is used for all write requests the FEE issues to the flash. Both flash addresses and job lengths </p>
<p>are always integer multiples of this value. Normally this value corresponds to the page size of the underlying flash </p>
<p>device and describes the smallest writeable unit of the flash hardware. Regarding to the microcontroller family </p>
<p>MPC560xB programming accesses to the flash are aligned to 8 byte (64 bit) address boundaries.  </p>
<p><b>3.2 </b></p>
<p><b>FEE Address Alignment </b></p>
<p>The address alignment influences the way FEE stores data entities in flash memory. Single entities, e.g. FEE </p>
<p>sector header, will start at addresses that are an integer multiple of FEE address alignment. In this way data </p>
<p>entities cannot influence other entities which are already stored in flash memory, especially if programming </p>
<p>accesses get aborted (i.e. ECC error), e.g. due to a reset. </p>
<p>In figure 4 different settings of address alignments are depicted in order to show the effect of this configuration </p>
<p>parameter. </p>
<p> </p>

<p><i>Application Note AN-ISC-8-1161 </i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Left diagram of figure 4 shows that the start address of each data block is aligned to an 8 byte (64 bit) boundary. </p>
<p>Whereas the right diagram pictures a configuration in which the start address of each data block is aligned to a 16 </p>
<p>byte (128 bit) boundary.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If performing read accesses to the flash memory, these configurations make a difference as soon as ECC errors </p>
<p>are considered. As illustrated in figure 3 an ECC error in one page corrupts the neighboring page due to the </p>
<p>hardware dependent size of read alignment. </p>
<p>Figure 5 points out that different data blocks have no influence on each other, if the address alignment setting </p>
<p>corresponds to the hardware dependent read alignment.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Figure 5 – ECC errors do not affect integrity of neighboring data blocks </p>
<p> </p>
<p>In figure 5 two different situations are shown. On the one hand (left diagram) an ECC error in the last page of data </p>
<p>block 1 occurred. Reading from this address will fail but the other data block is not affected by this. On the other </p>
<p>hand (right diagram) an ECC error in the first page of data block 2 will not impair the integrity of data block 1. </p>
<p>It is shown that an appropriate configuration of FEE address alignment ensures that data blocks do not corrupt </p>
<p>each other due to ECC errors. The start address of each data entity is aligned in a way that read requests always </p>
<p>access only one block at a time. </p>
<p><b>3.3 </b></p>
<p><b>Recommendation for FEE Alignment Configuration </b></p>
<p>As required by AUTOSAR, the MICROSAR FEE implementation is hardware independent. Still the MICROSAR </p>
<p>FEE provides a configurable write alignment and address alignment in order to address hardware dependent </p>
<p>characteristics. As it is illustrated using the example of MPC560xB platform, buffer sizes and alignments </p>
<p>constraints of read operations may differ from programming operations. In order to configure MICROSAR FEE </p>
<p>appropriately, it is recommended to check the hardware manual of the flash device for relevant data. Often this </p>
<p>information does not come out of manuals clearly. In case of ambiguity it is recommended to contact the </p>
<p>semiconductor manufacturer. </p>
<p>•</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Configuring FEE write alignment: </b></p>
<p>The value of FEE write alignment should be set to the page size of the flash device in bytes. Note that FEE </p>
<p>does not support write alignments smaller than 8 bytes due to internal reasons. </p>
<p>•</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Configuring FEE address alignment: </b></p>
<p>The value of the FEE address alignment should be set to the read alignment of the flash device in bytes. </p>
<p>Thus the start address of each data block is aligned in a way that ECC errors in one block do not corrupt </p>
